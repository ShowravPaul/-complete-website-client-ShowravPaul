## THE GREEN NURSERY

live site: https://the-green-nursery.netlify.app/

This is a website where one can get services about tree, plants and garden maintenance. One can order plants, or take a service for transferring a tree! But he shold be logged in before ordering any service. Here are two different sections for admin and users. An admin can make other one as an admin.

For developing this site HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React JS library have been used. For hosting client side, netlify has been used and for server side, I used free services of  heroku.com.
